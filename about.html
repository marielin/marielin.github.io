			<article id="about">Hi, my name's Marie. I'm a designer and engineer with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, looking for full-time work in the Bay Area. My interests are very diverse, ranging from visual design to computer architecture to UX to game design.
