CocoaNuts is a club for student iOS/macOS developers, and we meet weekly during the academic year. I have attended the club for many years and am a part of the leadership team. As a leadership member, I help other members complete the weekly demos and participate in leadership meetings. I also proposed the club's current restructuring effort. 

In March 2017, I contributed a demo for SpriteKit and GameplayKit. 

## Club Redesign Initiative
In Spring of 2017, I proposed a redesign of the club to increase attendance and retension. The restructuring will be rolled out over the next two semesters. 

Our plan is to better target our diverse body of potential members with separated services: a condensed 4-week workshop for iOS beginners, and a semester-long club for more dedicated members. Beginners tend to drop out of the weekly meetings within a few weeks; a concise, well-packaged workshop ending before midterms should increase retention in weeks 2-4. By having short-term members self-select to attend our workshop instead, our semester-long club members can establish camaraderie earlier in the semester, increasing retention of new members. 

I also created the new club logo and color scheme which is used throughout our promotional material. The fruit-and-leaf shape is designed to evoke Apple—the company whose devices our club is centered around—while the new green color scheme evokes freshness, offering more personality than pure white. 

[comment]: # (The 4-week workshop will teach beginner members essential concepts in a highly structured way that was not possible with our previous, modular meeting structure. We believe the 4-week timeline will allow new members to get a more complete experience, rather than only attending 1-2 meetings and leaving. The semester-long club will be similar to the existing club structure, but starting at the beginning of the semester should capture more members.)
