# article
In summer 2015, I interned on the Developer Publications team at Apple, under Games and Multimedia. My project was to design and develop sample code for the newly introduced GameplayKit framework, a framework giving developers an easy way to implement some common structures relevant to game development. I created a sample code project for four of GameplayKit's major features: entity-component architecture, pathfinding, state machines, and random number generation. 

I designed my samples to be accessible to new developers, showing off the API's usage while minimizing unrelated code. Each of my projects uses a one-touch/one-button interaction and simple graphics, minimizing input and graphics overhead. 

# Swift Playground
For my Randomization sample code project, I created a multi-page Swift playground instead of a traditional Xcode project. Randomization is an abstract concept, best demonstrated with numbers and graphs, so using a playground made sense. I wrote custom histogram generation code to visualize number distributions, and I worked with an editor to polish the multi-page document's text. Unfortunately the playground has not been published.
