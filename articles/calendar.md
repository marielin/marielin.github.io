In summer 2016, I interned on the iOS Calendar & Reminders team at Apple. My project was to design and implement a (not yet shipped) new feature for the iOS Calendar app. During the internship I gained experience in commercial software development, performed user research, and refined my presentation skills. 

## Software
This was my first time working within a large, preexisting code base. The feature required additions/modifications to a tall vertical slice of the stack—from daemons and databases to frameworks and UI—making this a full-stack project. From working with this code I learned a lot about the structure of commercial iOS applications, and also how to work collaboratively within a large department.

In addition, my previous experience on Apple's sample code team helped me write modular, easily comprehensible, and well-documented code that will be easy to update and maintain by other team members. 

## Design
In addition to implementation, I was in charge of designing the feature's UI. I conducted many interviews with users to research their needs, inconveniences, and existing workflows. From these interviews I gained a better understanding of their tasks and the relevant use cases, which informed the feature's functionality and UI. I created several mockups, did some user testing using paper prototypes, and settled upon a final UI to be approved by the design team.

## Presentation
While at Apple I greatly refined my presentation skills. I gave two presentations during Summer 2016: one individual presentation for my department's Vice President, and one group presentation (that I spearheaded) for a panel of VPs. Both times I was praised for my excellent presentation structure and delivery. I am very experienced at breaking down and selling a concept to groups of people, an invaluable skill for any designer or engineer.
